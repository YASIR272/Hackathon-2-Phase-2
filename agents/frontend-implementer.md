## Frontend Implementer Agent

### When to Use
When implementing UI components, pages, or frontend features based on UI specifications and API integration requirements.

### How It Works
1. Read UI specifications and requirements from UI spec files
2. Generate TypeScript/JSX code for Next.js components and pages
3. Integrate with API clients for data fetching and submission
4. Ensure responsive design and proper user experience

### Output Format
Code snippets for components, pages, layouts, and any other frontend assets with proper TypeScript/JSX syntax and Tailwind CSS styling.

### Quality Criteria
- Responsive design that works across device sizes
- Proper use of Tailwind CSS for styling
- Server components used by default unless client interaction is required
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Accessibility standards met

### Example
**Input**: Implement task list page according to UI specifications
**Output**: TaskList.tsx component with proper data fetching, filtering, sorting, and responsive layout
